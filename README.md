# Corona Model

A statistical aproach for modeling the number of cases of the Corona Virus in Brazil.

NOTE: This model is still in the early stages of development, so efficiency and accuracy may not be guaranteed. In addition, as the prevention measures adopted by the population come into effect, reducing the growth in the number of cases, this model will tend to become less accurate over time.
