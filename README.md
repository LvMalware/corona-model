# LSM

A simple statistics module, which provides 4 basic types of regressions using the Least Squares Method (LSM)

The file `lsm_test.pl` provides an unified interface for their use as a command line tool.

NOTE: This module is still in the early stages of development, so efficiency and accuracy are not guaranteed.
